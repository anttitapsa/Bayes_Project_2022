# Introduction

Can the grade point averages (GPAs) of first-year college students be predicted based on high school GPAs, SAT scores and other factors? This report presents a solution to this problem by applying two statistical models to predict the first-year college GPA. These models are fitted in Stan and compared according to Bayesian data analysis concepts. 

The report begins with a description of the data and the problem. After this, the models are introduced and their performances are analysed. Model improvements are then discussed and conclusions are made. Finally, self-reflection of the project is presented.

# Data and Problem 

The data contains information from a sample of 219 first year students at a midwestern college in 1996. The data has 10 variables:

```
GPA           First-year college GPA on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale
HSGPA         High school GPA on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale
SATV          Verbal/critical reading SAT score
SATM          Math SAT score
Male          1= male, 0= female
HU            Number of credit hours earned in humanities courses in high school
SS            Number of credit hours earned in social science courses in high school
FirstGen      1= student is the first in her or his family to attend college, 0=otherwise
White         1= white students, 0= others
CollegeBound  1=attended a high school where >=50% students intended to go on to college, 0=otherwise
```
The data can be obtained from: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Stat2Data/FirstYearGPA.html 

This report solves the problem of predicting the GPA of first-year college students using this data. Our models use all numerical values (HSGPA, SATV, SATM, HU and SS) to predict the first-year college GPA (GPA). In addition, the hierarchical model uses categorical variables Male and White to group the data into four different groups and predicts the GPA with group-level predictors. The barplot below represents these four groups and their sizes.

```{r data_barplot}
counts <- table(White=FirstYearGPA$White, Male=FirstYearGPA$Male)
barplot(counts,
  xlab="Gender", col=c("darkblue","red"),
  legend = c('Non-White', 'White'), ylab = 'Count', names=c('Female','Male'))
```

# Models

In this project, two different models are utilised: pooled and hierarchical model. Both are are covered in following sections. The mathematical notations, Stan implementations, and stan model runs are included in the sections. The both of the models follow the linear Gaussian model whose expected values are constructed using linear function with variables found in data (HSGPA, SATV, SATM, HU, and SS) and parameters $\alpha$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$, $\beta_4$, and $\beta_5$.   

## Pooled model

In pooled model, all the expected values are constructed using the common parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$s with weakly informative priors. All the GPAs have common $\sigma$. 

**Mathematical notation**

$$
\begin{aligned}
GPA_i &\sim N(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot HSGPA_i + \beta_2 \cdot SATV_i + \beta_3 \cdot SATM_i + \beta_4 \cdot HU_i + \beta_5 \cdot SS_i \\
\sigma &\sim N(0, 10) \\
\alpha &\sim N(0, 100) \\
\beta_k &\sim N(0, 100) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

**Stan code**

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("pooled.stan"))
```

**Running the model**

```{r data_pooled, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_pooled <- list(N = nrow(FirstYearGPA),
                    x = subset(FirstYearGPA, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                    y = FirstYearGPA$GPA,
                    musigma = 100,
                    sigmasigma = 10)
```

```{r pooled_model_fit}
mod_pooled <- cmdstan_model("pooled.stan")
fit_pooled <- mod_pooled$sample(data_pooled, refresh = 0, seed = 03091900)
```

## Hierarchical model

In Hierarchical model, students have been divided in four different groups: white males, white females, non white males, and non white females. All students in all the groups have own parameters $\alpha$s and $\beta$s which are constructed using common hyperparameters for all the different groups.

**Mathematical notation**

$$
\begin{aligned}
GPA_{ij} &\sim N(\mu_{ij}, \sigma) \\
\mu_{ij} &= \alpha_j + \beta_{1j} \cdot HSGPA_i + \beta_{2j} \cdot SATV_i + \beta_{3j} \cdot SATM_i + \beta_{4j} \cdot HU_i + \beta_{5j} \cdot SS_i \\
\sigma &\sim N(0, 10) \\
\alpha_j &\sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma_{\alpha}) \\
\beta_{1j} &\sim N(\mu_{\beta_1}, \sigma_{\beta_1}) \\
\beta_{2j} &\sim N(\mu_{\beta_2}, \sigma_{\beta_2}) \\
\beta_{3j} &\sim N(\mu_{\beta_3}, \sigma_{\beta_3}) \\
\beta_{4j} &\sim N(\mu_{\beta_4}, \sigma_{\beta_4}) \\
\beta_{5j} &\sim N(\mu_{\beta_5}, \sigma_{\beta_5}) \\
\mu_{\alpha} &\sim N(0,100) \\
\sigma_{\alpha} &\sim N(0,10) \\
\mu_{\beta_k} &\sim N(0,100) \\
\sigma_{\beta_k} &\sim N(0,10) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

**Stan code**

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("hierarchical.stan"))
```

**Running the model**

```{r data_hierarchical, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
male_white <- FirstYearGPA[FirstYearGPA$Male==1 & FirstYearGPA$White==1,]
male_non_white <- FirstYearGPA[FirstYearGPA$Male==1 & FirstYearGPA$White==0,]
female_white <- FirstYearGPA[FirstYearGPA$Male==0 & FirstYearGPA$White==1,]
female_non_white <- FirstYearGPA[FirstYearGPA$Male==0 & FirstYearGPA$White==0,]

data_hierarchical <- list(N1 = nrow(male_white),
                            N2 = nrow(male_non_white),
                            N3 = nrow(female_white),
                            N4 = nrow(female_non_white),
                            x1 = subset(male_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                            x2 = subset(male_non_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                            x3 = subset(female_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                            x4 = subset(female_non_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                            y1 = male_white$GPA,
                            y2 = male_non_white$GPA,
                            y3 = female_white$GPA,
                            y4 = female_non_white$GPA,
                            musigma = 100,
                            sigmasigma = 10)
```

```{r hierarchical_model_fit}
mod_hierarchical <- cmdstan_model("hierarchical.stan")
fit_hierarchical <-mod_hierarchical$sample(data_hierarchical, refresh = 0,
                                           seed = 03091900)
```

Weakly informative normal priors were used in both models. N(0,10) was the prior distribution for $\sigma$ in both models. In the pooled model, N(0,100) was the prior for both $\alpha$ and all $\beta_k$. The hierarchical model had similar priors: N(0,100) for all means $\mu_{\alpha}$ and $\mu_{\beta_k}$, and N(0,10) for all standard deviations $\sigma_{\alpha}$ and $\sigma_{\beta_k}$. We thought these priors reasonable for multiple reasons. Firstly, they all center on 0, which was thought wisest as we have no information whether the intercept $\alpha$ or the slopes $\beta_k$ should be positive or negative. Secondly, the standard deviations, 100 for the means and 10 for the standard deviations, were considered large enough to produce wide enough (but not too wide) prior distributions.

As can be seen from the above code lines, default values were used for running the MCMC chains. That is, 4 chains of 2000 iterations were run, and the first 1000 iterations of each chain were considered warm-up.

# Analysis and Results

## Converge diagnostics

### Pooled model

```{r pooled_rhat}
summary_pooled <- fit_pooled$summary()
sum(summary_pooled$rhat > 1.01)
sum(summary_pooled$rhat < 0.99)
```

```{r pooled_ess}
mean(summary_pooled$ess_tail)
sum(summary_pooled$ess_tail<400)
mean(summary_pooled$ess_bulk)
sum(summary_pooled$ess_bulk<400)
```

None of the $\hat{R}$-values for the pooled model exceeds 1.01 which indicates that there are no problems with the convergence of the set of simulated chains. The effective sample size (ESS) is over 400 (recommended threshold with four parallel chains, 100 per chain) for all of the ess_bulk and ess_tail values which indicates that the $\hat{R}$-estimate can be trusted to make decisions about convergence and the quality of the chains. In addition, the model does not observe divergence.

### Hierarchical model

```{r hierarchical_rhat}
summary_hierarchical <- fit_hierarchical$summary()
sum(summary_hierarchical$rhat > 1.01)
sum(summary_hierarchical$rhat < 0.99)
```

```{r hierarchical_ess}
mean(summary_hierarchical$ess_tail)
sum(summary_hierarchical$ess_tail<400)
mean(summary_hierarchical$ess_bulk)
sum(summary_hierarchical$ess_bulk<400)
```

Similarly to the pooled model, in the hierarchical model, no $\hat{R}$-values exceed 1.01, indicating that convergence is not a problem. A few ESS values are below 400 and the model gives a divergence of approximately 5%. These facts can indicate that there might be some problems with the convergence. On the other hand, these values do not differ significantly from the desired values the probability of having problems with convergence is small.


## Posterior predictive checks

48 histograms of replications of the data (created based on the posterior predictive distributions) are shown for all the models. In addition, there is over layed distributions and empirical cumulative distribution (ecdf) functions of 100 replications in the two with the original distribution and ecdf. These different plots of replication are compared to the plots of the original data to investigate, how good predictions fitted model can make. The closer the replications are original data, the better the predictions are.

### Pooled model

```{r pooled_posterior, fig.height=7.2}
y <- FirstYearGPA$GPA
ypred <- fit_pooled$draws("ypred", format = "matrix")

grid.arrange( ppc_hist(y, ypred[1:48,]),
              ppc_dens_overlay(y, ypred[1:100,]), 
              ppc_ecdf_overlay(y, ypred[1:100,]),
              layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2,1,3), nrow = 2), nrow=2)
```

### Hierarchical model

```{r hierarchical_posterior1, fig.height=7.2}
y1 <- data_hierarchical$y1
ypred1 <- fit_hierarchical$draws("ypred1", format = "matrix")

grid.arrange(ppc_hist(y1, ypred1[1:48,]),
ppc_dens_overlay(y1, ypred1[1:100,]),
ppc_ecdf_overlay(y1, ypred1[1:100,]),
              layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2,1,3), nrow = 2), nrow=2)
```

```{r hierarchical_posterior2, fig.height=7.2}
y2 <- data_hierarchical$y2
ypred2 <- fit_hierarchical$draws("ypred2", format = "matrix")

grid.arrange(ppc_hist(y2, ypred2[1:48,]),
ppc_dens_overlay(y2, ypred2[1:100,]),
ppc_ecdf_overlay(y2, ypred2[1:100,]),
              layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2,1,3), nrow = 2), nrow=2)
```

```{r hierarchical_posterior3, fig.height=7.2}
y3 <- data_hierarchical$y3
ypred3 <- fit_hierarchical$draws("ypred3", format = "matrix")

grid.arrange(ppc_hist(y3, ypred3[1:48,]),
ppc_dens_overlay(y3, ypred3[1:100,]),
ppc_ecdf_overlay(y3, ypred3[1:100,]),
              layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2,1,3), nrow = 2), nrow=2)
```

```{r hierarchical_posterior4, fig.height=7.2}
y4 <- data_hierarchical$y4
ypred4 <- fit_hierarchical$draws("ypred4", format = "matrix")

grid.arrange(ppc_hist(y4, ypred4[1:48,]),
ppc_dens_overlay(y4, ypred4[1:100,]),
ppc_ecdf_overlay(y4, ypred4[1:100,]),
              layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,2,1,3), nrow = 2), nrow=2)
```


## Prior sensitivity analysis

The original priors utilised were N$(0,100)$ for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ or their means, and N$(0,10)$ for all standard deviations. For prior sensitivity analysis, the priors presented in the table below were tested to see how much the posteriors of $\alpha$ and $\beta_k$ would differ from the original. Altogether, 8 prior combinations were tested, including the original priors for reference. The same prior combinations were used for testing both models. Narrower priors, e.g. N$(0,0.1)$, were excluded from the analysis, as they would not be weakly informative anymore.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
musigmas <- c(100, 1000, 50, 10, 1, 100, 100, 100)
sigmasigmas <- c(10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 100, 50, 1)

dimnames <- list(c("alpha, beta OR mu_alpha, mu_beta", "sigma, sigma_alpha, sigma_beta"),
                 c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8"))
prior_table <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = length(musigmas), dimnames = dimnames)

for (i in 1:length(musigmas)) {
  prior_table[1, i] <- paste0("N(0,", musigmas[i], ")")
  prior_table[2, i] <- paste0("N(0,", sigmasigmas[i], ")")
}

as.data.frame(prior_table)
```

### Pooled model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Takes ages to run, beware!
dimnames <- list(c("alpha", "beta1", "beta2", "beta3", "beta4", "beta5"),
                 c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8"))
mus_pooled <- matrix(nrow = 6, ncol = length(musigmas), dimnames = dimnames)
sigmas_pooled <- matrix(nrow = 6, ncol = length(musigmas), dimnames = dimnames)

for (i in 1:length(musigmas)) {
  data_pooled_sens <- list(N = nrow(FirstYearGPA),
                         x = subset(FirstYearGPA, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV',
                                                             'SATM','HU','SS')),
                         y = FirstYearGPA$GPA,
                         musigma = musigmas[i],
                         sigmasigma = sigmasigmas[i])
  fit_pooled_sens <- mod_pooled$sample(data_pooled_sens, refresh = 0,
                                       seed = 03091900)
  summary_sens <- fit_pooled_sens$summary()
  mus_pooled[,i] <- summary_sens$mean[2:7]
  sigmas_pooled[,i] <- summary_sens$sd[2:7]
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Posterior means")
as.data.frame(mus_pooled)
print("Posterior SDs")
as.data.frame(sigmas_pooled)
```

The above results show that regardless of the used priors, all posteriors for $\alpha$ and $\beta_k$ are very similar to each other. Therefore it can be concluded that the pooled model is not sensitive to changes in the priors.

### Hierarchical model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Takes ages to run, beware!
dimnames <- list(c("alpha1", "alpha2", "alpha3", "alpha4",
                   "beta1_1", "beta2_1", "beta3_1", "beta4_1", "beta5_1",
                   "beta1_2", "beta2_2", "beta3_2", "beta4_2", "beta5_2",
                   "beta1_3", "beta2_3", "beta3_3", "beta4_3", "beta5_3",
                   "beta1_4", "beta2_4", "beta3_4", "beta4_4", "beta5_4"),

mus_hierarchical <- matrix(nrow = 24, ncol = length(musigmas), dimnames = dimnames)
sigmas_hierarchical <- matrix(nrow = 24, ncol = length(musigmas), dimnames = dimnames)

for (i in 1:length(musigmas)) {
  data_hierarchical_sens <- list(N1 = nrow(male_white),
                                 N2 = nrow(male_non_white),
                                 N3 = nrow(female_white),
                                 N4 = nrow(female_non_white),
                                 x1 = subset(male_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                                 x2 = subset(male_non_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                                 x3 = subset(female_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                                 x4 = subset(female_non_white, select = c('HSGPA', 'SATV', 'SATM','HU','SS')),
                                 y1 = male_white$GPA,
                                 y2 = male_non_white$GPA,
                                 y3 = female_white$GPA,
                                 y4 = female_non_white$GPA,
                                 musigma = musigmas[i],
                                 sigmasigma = sigmasigmas[i])
  fit_hierarchical_sens <- mod_hierarchical$sample(data_hierarchical_sens,
                                                   refresh = 0,
                                                   seed = 03091900)
  summary_sens <- fit_hierarchical_sens$summary()
  mus_hierarchical[,i] <- summary_sens$mean[2:25]
  sigmas_hierarchical[,i] <- summary_sens$sd[2:25]
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Posterior means")
as.data.frame(mus_hierarchical)
print("Posterior SDs")
as.data.frame(sigmas_hierarchical)
```

There is slightly more variation in the posteriors of the hierarchical model when various priors are utilised, but the posteriors look quite similar nonetheless. It can be concluded that the hierarchical model, similarly to the pooled model, is not sensitive to changes in the priors.


## Posterior distributions

Next, let us inspect and visualise the posterior distributions of $\alpha$ and $\beta_k$. The table below contains the posterior distributions of the six variables for the pooled model and all 4 groups of the hierarchical model separately.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dimnames <- list(c("alpha", "beta1", "beta2", "beta3", "beta4", "beta5"),
                 c("pooled", "h. group 1", "h. group 2",
                   "h. group 3", "h. group 4"))
post_table <- matrix(nrow = 6, ncol = 5, dimnames = dimnames)

# Fill 1st column
for (i in 1:6) {
  mean <- summary_pooled$mean[1+i]
  sd <- summary_pooled$sd[1+i]
  post_table[i,1] <- paste0("N(", round(mean,3), ", ", round(sd,3), ")")
}
# Fill other columns
# first alphas
for (i in 1:4) {
  mean <- summary_hierarchical$mean[1+i]
  sd <- summary_hierarchical$sd[1+i]
  post_table[1, 1+i] <- paste0("N(", round(mean,3), ", ", round(sd,3), ")")
}
# then betas
for (i in 1:4) {
  for(j in 1:5) {
    mean <- summary_hierarchical$mean[5+(i-1)*5+j]
    sd <- summary_hierarchical$sd[5+(i-1)*5+j]
    post_table[j+1,i+1] <- paste0("N(", round(mean,3), ", ", round(sd,3), ")")
  }
}

as.data.frame(post_table)
```

Let us also plot the posterior distributions.

### Hierarchical model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
x <- seq(-2, 2, length = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x, mean = summary_pooled$mean[2], sd = summary_pooled$sd[2])
plot(x, y, type = "l", xlab = "alpha")
for (i in 1:5) {
  x <- seq(-1, 1, length = 1000)
  y <- dnorm(x, mean = summary_pooled$mean[2+i], sd = summary_pooled$sd[2+i])
  plot(x, y, type = "l", xlab = paste0("beta", i))
}
```

The plot shows that the slope parameter $\beta_1$, multiplying the variable for high school GPA, likely differs from 0 and has the most effect on college GPA, our target variable. The other $\beta$s have very narrow distributions close to 0, though, implying their effect on college GPA is very small or non-existent.

### Hierarchical model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Each group's parameters get its own plots (4 3x2 plots in total)
for (i in 1:4) {
  par(mfrow = c(3,2))
  x <- seq(-2, 2, length = 1000)
  y <- dnorm(x, mean = summary_hierarchical$mean[1+i], sd = summary_hierarchical$sd[1+i])
  plot(x, y, type = "l", xlab = "alpha")
  for (j in 1:5) {
    x <- seq(-1, 1, length = 1000)
    y <- dnorm(x, mean = summary_hierarchical$mean[5+(i-1)*5+j], sd = summary_hierarchical$sd[5+(i-1)*5+j])

The posteriors of the hierarchical model are quite similar to the pooled model. The intercept terms $\alpha$ of groups 1 and 3, and of groups 2 and 4, are very similar to each other, implying that the ethnicity of the student governs the intercept term $\alpha$. Furthermore, there is slight variation in the slope terms $\beta_k$, especially $\beta_5$: for groups with less data, the distributions are narrower, and for groups with more data, wider.


## Model comparison

The log likelihoods of the data have been calculated in the "generated quantities" blocks of the models. They are given to the "loo" function of the "loo" package, and the individual results and model comparison are printed.

```{r}
log_lik_pooled <- fit_pooled$draws("log_lik", format = "matrix")
log_lik_hierarchical <- fit_hierarchical$draws("log_lik", format = "matrix")

loo_pooled <- loo(log_lik_pooled)
loo_hierarchical <- loo(log_lik_hierarchical)

loo_pooled
loo_hierarchical
loo_compare(list("pooled" = loo_pooled, "hierarchical" = loo_hierarchical))
```

The results show that the PSIS-LOO estimate for the pooled model can be considered reliable, as all values $\hat{k} \lesssim 0.7$. The same cannot be said of the hierarchical model, and the PSIS-LOO estimate for it should be considered, or at least suspected, biased and overly optimistic.

Comparing the two models reveals that the pooled model seems to fit to the data  better than the hierarchical model (likely due to the lack of training data for the latter one). Therefore for any future predictions, the pooled model should be utilised.

# Discussion about problems and improvements

The overall problem in the project was that there was not enough data. For example in hierarchical model, some of the data groups were quite small: th group of non white groups only contained 18 and 28 data, and the rest of the 173 data points were distributed between white groups. In addition, there was big variation in the magnitudes of the variables (HSGPA etc.). This could have been solved by using normalisation.

There were divergences in the hierarchical model. If there was more time, the divergences could have been solved by analysing more the running of the model; The default values (the number of the chains, the number of the iterations etc.) were utilised during the model fitting. Furthermore, testing out different priors to solve the divergence issue.

# Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the pooled model describes the data better than the hierarchical model. However, both models performed well. The hierarchical model describes the white and non white students differently. So according to the hierarchical model, there were more differences between white and non-white students than between male and female students. This can be seen most clearly from the posterior distributions of the $\alpha$s.

# Self-reflection

During the project, we noticed that finding the data is difficult and time consuming. Moreover, the pre-processing of the data and deciding the suitable data groups for the hierarchical model was surprisingly time consuming. We also noticed the importance of the amount of the data: more data, better model.

We learned to make more complicated stan models.
